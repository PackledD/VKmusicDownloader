Soft to download your music from vk.com
The software does not save your data anywhere other than your computer.

The "Select all" button selects all songs, and the "Remove selection" button, on the contrary, cancels the selection.
The "Open" button is used to select the folder where the music will be saved (a subfolder will be created "downloads")
